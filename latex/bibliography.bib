 abstract = {We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation networks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

abstract = {Situation aware route planning gathers increasing interest as cities become crowded and jammed. We present a system for individual trip planning that incorporates future traffic hazards in routing. Future traffic conditions are computed by a Spatio-Temporal Random Field based on a stream of sensor readings. In addition, our approach estimates traffic flow in areas with low sensor coverage using a Gaussian Process Regression. The conditioning of spatial regression on intermediate predictions of a discrete probabilistic graphical model allows us to incorporate historical data, streamed online data and a rich dependency structure at the same time. We demonstrate the system with a real-world use-case from Dublin city, Ireland.}
