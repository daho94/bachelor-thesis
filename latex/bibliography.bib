 abstract = {We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation networks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

abstract = {Situation aware route planning gathers increasing interest as cities become crowded and jammed. We present a system for individual trip planning that incorporates future traffic hazards in routing. Future traffic conditions are computed by a Spatio-Temporal Random Field based on a stream of sensor readings. In addition, our approach estimates traffic flow in areas with low sensor coverage using a Gaussian Process Regression. The conditioning of spatial regression on intermediate predictions of a discrete probabilistic graphical model allows us to incorporate historical data, streamed online data and a rich dependency structure at the same time. We demonstrate the system with a real-world use-case from Dublin city, Ireland.}

abstract="During the last years, several speed-up techniques for Dijkstra's algorithm have been published that maintain the correctness of the algorithm but reduce its running time for typical instances. They are usually based on a preprocessing that annotates the graph with additional information which can be used to prune or guide the search. Timetable information in public transport is a traditional application domain for such techniques. In this paper, we provide a condensed overview of new developments and extensions of classic results. Furthermore, we discuss how combinations of speed-up techniques can be realized to take advantage from different strategies.",

abstract = {Urban scholars have studied street networks in various ways, but there are data availability and consistency limitations to the current urban planning/street network analysis literature. To address these challenges, this article presents OSMnx, a new tool to make the collection of data and creation and analysis of street networks simple, consistent, automatable and sound from the perspectives of graph theory, transportation, and urban design. OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.}
